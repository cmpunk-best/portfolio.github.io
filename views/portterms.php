            <p>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</p>
            <h5>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (&quot;Statement,&quot; &quot;Terms,&quot; or &quot;SRR&quot;) derives from the Portfolio
Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with
Portfolio, as well as Portfolio brands, products and services, which we call the “Portfolio Services” or “Services”.
By using or accessing the Portfolio Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in
accordance with Section below. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you
understand how Portfolio works.
Because Portfolio provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms
that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms
conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to
your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.</h5>

                    <p class="text-left">Sharing Your Content and Information</p>

                    <ol class="text-left">
                        You own all of the content and information you post on Portfolio, and you can control how it is shared through
your privacy and application settings. In addition:
                        <li>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you
specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant
us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content
that you post on or in connection with Portfolio (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your
IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted
it.</li>
                        <li>
                            When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.
However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of
time (but will not be available to others).

                        <li>
                            When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and
information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require
applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the
application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Platform,
including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data
Policy and Platform Page.)

                            When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing
everyone, including people off of Portfolio, to access and use that information, and to associate it with
you (i.e., your name and profile picture).

                            We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Portfolio, but you understand that we
may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you
have no obligation to offer them).

nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.

that does not closely relate to a user&#39;s actual name).
